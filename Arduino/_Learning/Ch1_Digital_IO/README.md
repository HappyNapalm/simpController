# Digital General Purpose Inputs and Outputs #
This section is going to cover how to get digital GPIO working through the Arduino Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). For the purpose of this section, it is assumed that you are using an Arduino Nano.

## Exercise 1 ##
Toggle the LED connected to D13 on the Arduino Nano PCB every second.

## Exercise 2 ##
Using a button wired on a breadboard like Schematic1.png, make the LED connected to D13 change states with each button press.

## Exercise 3 ##
Using the system described in Exercise 2, have the Arduino report the state of the button serially. Do you notice anything interesting in the serial string response?

## Bonus Credit ##
Create a demo using the Pulse Width Modulation pin of the Arduino Nano.
