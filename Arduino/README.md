This is the Arduino design section of the project. All things that iterate on the Arduino path should be placed in this subdirectory. Please contact the project dev if this is not the case.

# Target Arduino #
Arduino Nano 

## Software Required ##
1. Arduino IDE
2. Quite Useful Circuit Simulator (QUCS)
3. KiCAD 
4. Your desired PDF Viewer

The IDE is require to write and flash code to the hardware. 
QUCS is a tool for learning and simulating designs.
KiCAD is for iterating on PCB Designs associated with the project.
